# Data-Science-Profile

Repository containing portfolio of data science projects completed by me for academic, self learning, and hobby purposes. Presented in the form of iPython Notebooks.

Have a visually pleasant experience while  browsing the portfolio.

_Note: Data used in the projects (accessed under data directory) is for demonstration purposes only._

## Instructions for Running Python Notebooks Locally
1. Install dependencies using requirements.txt.
2. Run notebooks as usual by using a jupyter notebook server, Vscode etc.

###Deep Learning
	-[Model Building using ANN](https://github.com/Faisalnb/Data-Science-Profile/blob/main/Deep%20Learning/Model%20building%20using%20ANN.ipynb):For companies like Lending Club correctly predicting whether or not a loan will be a default is very important. In this project, using the historical data from 2007 to 2015, I  build a deep learning model to predict the chance of default for future loans.Analysis to be done: Perform data preprocessing and build a deep learning prediction model.
